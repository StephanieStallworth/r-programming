## My First Map
For this assignment, I created a map of my alma mater The University of Dayton (Go Flyers!)

First steps was to load necessary packages
```{r, warning = FALSE, message =FALSE }
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)

```

Next, a map object was created

```{r, eval = FALSE}

myMap<-leaflet() %>% 
        addTiles()
myMap
```

University of Dayton website was then marked on the map with a link to get additional information
```{r}
UD<- c("<a href = 'https://udayton.edu'>University of Dayton</a>") 
leaflet() %>% 
addTiles() %>% 
addMarkers(lat = 39.740415, lng= -84.1792132, popup = UD)
```
